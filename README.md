# ðŸ“š Library Management System (C++ & Qt)

This project is a graphical Library Management System built using C++ and the Qt framework. It allows users to manage a collection of books, articles, theses, and digital content through an intuitive GUI. Users can add new resources, register library users, and manage borrowing and returning of items. All data is stored in structured CSV (text) files using Qt's `QFile` and `QTextStream` classes, making the data human-readable and easy to maintain. The application is organized into tabs for Books, Articles, Theses, Digital Content, Users, and Loans. Each section allows for specific operations such as adding new entries, viewing stored records, searching, and filtering.
